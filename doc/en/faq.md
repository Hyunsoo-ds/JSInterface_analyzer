# FAQ

## 1. How does Appshark differ from Soot?
Appshark analyzes the Jimple IR generated by Soot. Appshark relies on Soot, but Appshark has its independent rule system as well as independently implemented pointer analysis and taint analysis.

## 2. How does Appshark differ from Flowdroid?
Appshark reuses Flowdroid's parsing module to process the AndroidManifest.xml file and various resource files. However, Appshark has its independent rule system as well as independently implemented pointer analysis and taint analysis.

## 3. What problem might be caused by sliceMode?

```java
public class SliceMode {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      A x=new A();
      A y=x;
      f(x,y);
    }
    void f(A x,A y){
        dosource(x);
        dosink(y);
    }
    void dosource(A x){
        x.f=source();
    }
    void dosink(A y){
        sink(y.f);
    }
}
```

SliceMode treats f() as the entry method, then it fails to discover that x and y point to the same object. Thus, it cannot detect a feasible path from source and sink, leading to a FN.

## 4. Field sensitivity
Appshark's analysis is field sensitive, and does not mix up the propagation of different fields. 
For example,
```java
public class FieldSensitive{
    public static void main(){
        A x=new A();
        x.f1=source();
        sink(x.f2);
    }
}
```
Appshark will not detect a path from source to sink, because x.f1 and x.f2 are different fields.
